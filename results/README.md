# Results Directory

This is the repository directory where you should save and commit your
predicted `p_factor` values as a TSV file prior to issuing a pull request for
your results. Instructions and example code for doing this can be found in the
sample notebook in the root of the repository.

When you save your results TSV file, make sure to name the results file after
your group (feel free to come up with a group name). Once you have saved the
file, you should commit it, push it to GitHub, then submit a pull request from
your repository to the `results` branch of the [original repository](
https://github.com/NeuroHackademy2025/rbc-projects-template).
